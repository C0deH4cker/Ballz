Ballz
=====

Quick and simple sample game made using SGE


Not so much of a game as a test of some functionality provided by SGE.

Left clicking adds a new ball with a random size and starting velocity. Right clicking on a ball deletes it.
The arrow keys basically create gravity in the direction of whichever arrow was pressed. Using the scroll wheel
also affects the balls' velocity. Spacebar makes all balls on the screen freeze. This sample uses a custom mouse cursor and a fixed size window.

Not by any means intended to actually be played. Just a demo project.
